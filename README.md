# Group15_SEP769_CPS-DL_Final_Project
This project aims to forecast hourly vehicle traffic at urban junctions using deep learning models. It compares the performance of Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to identify the most effective model for smart traffic prediction.
